# One-to-many Object Relationships Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create a one-to-many relationship.

## Key Vocab

- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
  accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Object**: the more common name for an instance. The two can usually be used
  interchangeably.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: programming that is oriented around data
  (made mobile and changeable in **objects**) rather than functionality. Python
  is an object-oriented programming language.
- **Function**: a series of steps that create, transform, and move data.
- **Method**: a function that is defined inside of a class.

## Introduction

In this lab we will implement a one-to-many relationship between a `Owner` and
`Pet`.

---

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment. Then run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in the `lib/` folder.

Instructions:

- Define an `Owner` class and pass into the constructor a `name` argument.
- Define a `Pet` and pass into the constructor its `name`, `pet_type` and an
  optional `owner`.
- Define a class variable
  `PET_TYPES = ["dog", "cat", "rodent", "bird", "reptile", "exotic"]` and
  validate that the `pet_type` is one of those types in the `__init__` method.
  - `raise Exception` if this check fails.
- Define a class variable `all` that stores all instances of the `Pet` class.
- In the `Owner` class write a method called `pets(self)` that returns a full
  list of the owner's pets.
- In the `Owner` class write a method called `add_pet(self, pet)` that checks
  that the the pet is of type `Pet` and adds the owner to the pet.
- In the `Owner` class write a method called `get_sorted_pets(self)` returns a
  sorted list of pets by their names.
- `Owner` and `Pet` should use `isinstance` to check types whenever instances
  are passed into methods.
  - `raise Exception` if these checks fail.
